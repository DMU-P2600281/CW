        <p>Black Panther</p>
        <p><img src="img/chadwick.img" alt="Chadwick Boseman" style="max width: 100%"/>
Chadwick Boseman was an American actor. He was born on
          the 29th November 1976 and unfortunately passed away on 28th August
          2020.
        He starred in 15 films and 16 television programmes. His best film
        in my opinion,by far, is Black Panther but the film where he had his big
        break was as a baseball player Jackie Robinson in the film
        '42'.
        He was nominated for 37 awards and won 10 of them,this man achieved so
        much in his life that he lived,may he rest in
        eternal peace.
