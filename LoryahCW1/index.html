  <h3>Synopsis
  <section>
  <p>Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after
    the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home
    to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to
    succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king.
    But when a powerful old enemy reappears, T’Challa’s mettle
    as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn into a formidable
    conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk.
    Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies
    and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure
    the safety of his people and their way of life.</p>
