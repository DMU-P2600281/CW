    <h2>Egyptian Mau</h2>

       <img src="img/egyptianmau.img" alt="Egyptian Mau" style="max width: 100%"/>
       In 1953, a noblewoman returned to Italy from Egypt with a tabby cat.
       This tabby cat was bred to a male tabby that had also been brought
       to Italy from Egypt, this time with the help of a Syrian ambassador.
       In 1956, the progeny of this original pair were brought to the United
       States by this noblewoman, and the Egyptian mau was created. "mau,"
       in Egyptian, means "cat."

<h3>Sphynx</h3>

<img src="img/sphynx.img" alt="Sphynx" style="max width: 100%">
    The progenitor of the Sphynx appeared in Toronto, Canada,
    in 1966, born to a domestic cat with a regular coat.
    The hairlessness is the result of a natural mutation
    and wasnâ€™t the first example of hairlessness in cats.
    A pair of hairless cats had been known of in Mexico at
    the turn of the last century, but they were not related
    to the modern Sphynx.

<h4>Ragdoll</h4>

<img src="img/ragdoll.img" alt="Ragdoll" style="max width: 100%">
The History of Ragdolls is not that extensive because Ragdolls
are a relatively new breed of cat compared to others.
The first Ragdolls were bred California in the 1960s by Ann Baker.
